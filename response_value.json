			"Questions and Answers for LG QNED 85T Series TV - 65QNED85TUA\n\nQ: Why did LG choose to use the QNED85 terminology on this 2024 TV, since the previous version of the QNED85 (2022) was Mini-LED technology? This caused me great confusion in my purchasing decision, thinking this was a Mini-LED TV.\nA: Hi. LG QNED TVs are LCD-based and use a combination of quantum dot and NanoCell technologies with Mini LED backlighting. Even though the terminology for the LG 65-inch Class QNED 4K LED QNED85T series TV with webOS 24, Model # 65QNED85TUA, does not mention Mini LED backlighting, it still uses Mini LED backlighting as do all other LG QNED TVs. For more information, you can visit the product page at https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-65qned85taa-qned-4k-tv. ^Ivan\n\nQ: Is it the same as the LG QNED 85?\nA: Hey there. Shopping for that perfect LG TV can be tedious. We will need the other TV model number to compare the difference. However, we made it so easy for you to sit back and compare our TV specs and features and make the perfect selection because we all have our differences in what is better. Under the add cart, just toggle the \"COMPARE\" button, and you can compare up to four TVs simultaneously. For more questions, connect to our live agent by clicking the \"Live chat\" button below. ^David\n\nQ: Does webOS 24 support SMB shares (find SMB shares on the local area network and play videos directly from SMB share)? Do webOS24 TVs have Kodi app pre-installed? If not, is Kodi downloadable?\nA: Hi there! WebOS 24 does not support SMB share. However, please refer to the link below for a tutorial on how to share files from your TV to your favorite personal device. They'd have to be on the same network to do so. At the moment, the Kodi app isn't pre-installed on LG TVs, nor is it available on the LG content store. For further support, please reach out to us on social media (@LGUSSupport)! We're always just a few clicks away! ^Chris\nFor more details, please visit https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-65qned85taa-qned-4k-tv.\n\nQ: What is the better TV, the LG QNED 85, 2024, or the LG QNED 85T, 2024?\nA: Hey there. Shopping for that perfect LG TV can be tedious. However, we made it so easy for you to sit back and compare our TV features and make the perfect selection because we all have our differences in what is better. Under the add cart, just toggle the \"COMPARE\" button, and you can compare up to four TVs simultaneously. For more questions, connect to our live agent by clicking the \"Live chat\" button below. ^David\n\nQ: Is this the LG top of the line 85T QNED in the LG lineup at this point of time?\nA: Hey there, Arveien! Our top lineup QNED TV of its Class is the MiniLED, which boasts a rich dark-level detail with minimal halo effect! Furthermore, this 65-inch Class QNED 4K LED QNED85T series TV with webOS 24 would be the second of its top lineup! ^Anthony\n\nQ: When will an ATSC 3.0 (NEXTGEN) broadcast tuner be available?\nA: Hi, DLJags. Regrettably, none of our 2024 LG TVs nor the LG 65-inch Class QNED 4K LED QNED85T series TV with webOS 24, Model # 65QNED85TUA, will feature a NEXTGEN (ATSC 3.0) tuner that was included in all of our flagship OLED and LED TVs for several years in anticipation of the new OTA digital standard becoming the way that all US broadcasters deliver content via antenna. ^Ivan\n\nQ: And do it has Picture Wizard?\nA: Hey there, Arveien! After more research, it seems like this 65QNED85TUA model comes with something other than Picture Wizard. If you have any other questions, please feel free to connect to our live agent by clicking the \"Live chat\" button below, and make sure to include your contact details, model, and serial number. ^Anthony",
